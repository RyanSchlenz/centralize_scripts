# centralize_scripts
Overview
Develop Scripts: Team members develop scripts locally and push them to GitHub.
CI/CD with GitHub Actions: Automatically build and deploy these scripts as Docker containers.
Host Script Execution Server: Use a cloud service to host the Docker containers and expose APIs.
Frontend in Retool: Connect the Retool frontend to the backend APIs for script execution and permission management.



Detailed Steps
1. Set Up GitHub Repository
Create a GitHub repository for your project.
Add your scripts and a Dockerfile for building the container.

2. GitHub Actions for CI/CD (Example Workflow (ci-cd.yml))
Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository.
Add a GitHub Actions workflow to build and push Docker images to GitHub Packages.

3. Deploy Docker Container to Cloud
Use a cloud service like AWS ECS, GCP GKE, or Azure AKS to deploy your Docker container.

4. Expose APIs
Ensure your Docker container runs a server (e.g., Flask for Python) that exposes API endpoints for executing scripts.
